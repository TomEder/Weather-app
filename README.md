# 🌦️ Weather Application

This is a weather application built using **React** that fetches weather data for the user's current location. The app utilizes **geolocation** to determine the user's coordinates and displays relevant weather information such as temperature, weather condition, humidity, and the current time.

## ✨ Features
- **Geolocation**: Automatically detects the user's current location using the browser's geolocation API.
- **Real-time Clock**: Displays the current date and time in a readable format that updates every second.
- **Weather Data**: Displays the current temperature, weather condition, humidity, and a relevant weather icon.

## 🛠 Technologies Used
- **React**: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- **Axios**: For making HTTP requests to the weather API.
- **CSS**: Tailwind CSS classes are used for styling.

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- **Node.js** and **npm** installed on your system.

### Installation
1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/weather-app.git
   ```
2. **Navigate to the project directory**:
   ```sh
   cd weather-app
   ```
3. **Install the dependencies**:
   ```sh
   npm install
   ```

### Running the App
1. **Create a `.env` file** in the root directory and add your weather API key:
   ```env
   REACT_APP_WEATHER_API=https://api.yourweatherprovider.com
   ```
2. **Start the development server**:
   ```sh
   npm start
   ```
3. **Open your browser** and go to `http://localhost:3000` to view the application.

## 📋 Usage
- When you first open the app, it will ask for permission to access your location. If permission is granted, the app will display the current weather information for your location.
- The weather icon will change based on the current weather condition (e.g., sunny, cloudy, rainy).

## ⚙️ Environment Variables
Make sure to create a `.env` file with your weather API key:
```env
REACT_APP_WEATHER_API=https://api.yourweatherprovider.com
```

## 🔍 Notes
- **Geolocation Permission**: The app requires permission to access the user's location. If permission is denied, the weather data will not be available.
- **Environment Security**: Make sure **not to push** your `.env` file to the repository to keep your API key secure.
